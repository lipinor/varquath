# VarQuaTh

Hello! My name is Filipe, this is a project I wrote, VarQuaTh. Its goal is to make it easier to implement the [Variational Quantum Thermalizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02071) 
algorithm within the IBM Qiskit framework.

You can check the tutorial to learn how to use it with some examples.

If this code is helpful for you, feel free to use and reference it. If you are interested, an implementation of the VQT in the context of 
Quantum Thermodynamics can be found [here](https://github.com/lipinor/two-stroke-qhe-vqt).
